## Overview

LifeOS is a personal project I’m building throughout December as part of a 31-day AI challenge.

My goal is to create a mobile-first AI assistant that helps with planning, organisation, discipline, and self-reflection — something I would actually use every day. I also see this project as a way to build consistency and deepen my skills in AI engineering.

---

## MVP Architecture (v0.1 - Early Stage)

| Component | Technology | Role |
|----------|------------|------|
| **Backend API** | FastAPI (Python) | Core server handling AI logic |
| **AI Engine** | OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini) | Intent parsing & natural language understanding |
| **Data Models** | Pydantic | Defines structured intents |
| **Storage** | JSON / SQLite (planned) | Will store tasks, reminders, and diary entries |
| **Mobile UI** | React Native (planned) | Future mobile-first interface |

---

## Daily Progress

### **Day 1:** Intent Parser (Dec 1, 2025)

Today I implemented the first foundational feature:  
**the Intent Parser** — the component that translates natural language into structured data the app can act on.

This is the “language brain” of LifeOS.

#### What It Does

| Capability | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Intent Detection** | Identifies `event`, `reminder`, `diary`, and `memory` messages |
| **Date Understanding** | Handles “today”, “tomorrow”, weekdays, and relative phrases |
| **Time Extraction** | Converts natural language time into standard formats |
| **Category Inference** | Detects simple categories (health, work, personal, social) |
| **Timezone Handling** | Uses `Europe/London` as default |

---

#### Example: Natural Language → Structured Intent

**Input:**  
> “Add gym tomorrow at 6pm”

**Output (JSON):**

```json
{
  "intent_type": "event",
  "title": "gym",
  "date": "2025-12-02",
  "time": "18:00",
  "datetime": "2025-12-02 18:00",
  "category": "health",
  "notes": null
}
```


This will serve as the foundation for scheduling, reminders, journaling, and future agentic behaviour.

### **Day 2:** Data Models, Storage & CRUD API (Dec 2, 2025)

Today I built the data foundation of LifeOS — giving the system a place to store structured information permanently.

Yesterday, the assistant could understand commands. Today, it can remember them.

#### What I Built

**1. Core Data Models (Pydantic)**

| Model | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Task** | Stores events & reminders |
| **DiaryEntry** | Stores daily reflections |
| **Memory** | Stores long-term personal preferences |
| **BaseItem** | Provides unique IDs for all items |

**2. JSON Storage Layer**

A simple persistent storage file located at: `backend/app/db/data.json`


Initial schema:

```json
{
  "tasks": [],
  "diary": [],
  "memories": []
}
```

Lightweight now, easily replaced with SQLite later.

**3. Intent → Storage Pipeline**

LifeOS can now take a parsed intent and save it as:
- an event
- a reminder
- a diary entry
- a memory

This completes the first full loop:
`natural language → structured intent → persistent data`

**4. CRUD Endpoints (FastAPI)**

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /tasks` | Return all tasks |
| `GET /diary` | Return diary entries |
| `GET /memories` | Return stored memories |
| `GET /all` | Return entire database |
| `POST /clear` | Reset everything (dev only) |


#### Example: Saved Data Snapshot

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "cdf98f06-07db-4721-b868-40dc6b1faf61",
      "type": "reminder",
      "title": "buy milk",
      "date": "2025-12-02",
      "time": "09:00",
      "datetime": "2025-12-02 09:00",
      "category": "errands",
      "notes": null
    }
  ],
  "diary": [],
  "memories": []
}
```

LifeOS now has persistent memory, which is a major milestone.

#### Tech Stack (Day 2)
- FastAPI
- Python
- Pydantic
- JSON file storage
- Repository pattern

### **Day 3:** Task Engine, Calendar Logic & Core Enhancements (Dec 3, 2025)

Today was a big step. LifeOS moved from “storing data” to actually **understanding time**, organising it, and preparing for future intelligent behaviour.

This was the day LifeOS started behaving like a real personal operating system, not just a parser.

---

#### What I Built

**1. Task Engine (the heart of scheduling)**  
I created a full engine for organising tasks:

- **Datetime normalisation** - all tasks now have a unified `datetime` field  
- **Status detection** — `today`, `upcoming`, `overdue`, or `unscheduled`  
- **Sorting** - global chronological ordering  
- **Filtering functions**  
  - `get_tasks_today()`  
  - `get_upcoming_tasks()`  
  - `get_overdue_tasks()`  
  - `get_next_task()`  

This gives LifeOS the basic intelligence to understand *when* things happen and how to structure them.

---

**2. Calendar-Friendly Structure**  
Tasks can now be grouped by date:

```json
{
  "2025-12-02": [...],
  "2025-12-05": [...],
  "2025-12-20": [...]
}
```

I also added `group_tasks_pretty()` — a UI-friendly version for the future mobile app.

---

**3. New API Endpoints**

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /tasks/today` | Tasks for today |
| `GET /tasks/upcoming` | Chronological future tasks |
| `GET /tasks/overdue` | Tasks whose time has passed |
| `GET /tasks/next` | The very next upcoming task |
| `GET /tasks/grouped` | Calendar-style grouped tasks |
| `GET /tasks/grouped-pretty` | UI-friendly grouping |
| `GET /tasks/summary` | Daily overview & stats |

LifeOS now has everything needed for a real schedule view.

---

#### ⭐ Engine Enhancements & Intelligence Prep

Today I also added several foundational upgrades that will power future features.

**1. Duration & End Time**  
Added to the `Task` model:

```python
duration_minutes: Optional[int] = None
end_datetime: Optional[str] = None
```

This prepares LifeOS for:

- conflict detection  
- free-time blocks  
- timeline visualisation  

**2. Event/Reminder Filtering**

```
GET /tasks/events
GET /tasks/reminders
```

**3. Task Completion**

```
POST /tasks/{id}/complete
```

Allows marking tasks as done — needed for habit-tracking and stats.

---

#### Intelligence Preparation

Added to the `Task` model:

- `energy` (low/medium/high)  
- `context` (work/home/laptop/outside/errand)  

And improved the parser so it now handles:

- “by Friday”  
- “in an hour”  
- “in 30 minutes”  
- “after work”  
- “this evening”

These small pieces will become the core of LifeOS’s agentic intelligence later.

---

#### Architecture Improvements

- **Error handling** for malformed dates  
- **Logging** (`app/logging.py`) added across repo, parser, task engine  
- **Better `/tasks` sorting** (status → datetime)  
- **Stats endpoint** (`GET /stats`)  
- **Quick-add endpoint** (`POST /tasks/add`)

These upgrades make the backend much more stable and professional.

---

#### Reflection

Day 3 was the moment LifeOS stopped being just an LLM wrapper and became a **system** with memory, structure, behaviour, and time awareness.

Building this reminded me why I started this challenge - to create something I would personally use every day, and to sharpen my engineering skills through real, hands-on work.

### **Day 4:** Weekly View, Conflict Detection & Assistant Insights (Dec 4, 2025)

Today I moved from looking at tasks “one day at a time” to something closer to how I actually think: weeks, patterns, and gentle insights about my schedule. LifeOS is starting to feel less like a list API and more like a small planning brain.

---

#### Weekly View & Calendar Range

I added a proper **week engine** that understands a Monday–Sunday week in `Europe/London` time.

**New logic (`week_engine.py`):**

- `get_current_week_boundaries()` → finds this week’s **Monday–Sunday**
- `get_week_view()` → groups tasks by day for the current week
- `get_tasks_in_range(start, end)` → generic **calendar range helper** for any date window

**New endpoints:**

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /tasks/week` | Current week view (Mon–Sun), tasks grouped by day |
| `GET /tasks/calendar?start=YYYY-MM-DD&end=YYYY-MM-DD` | Generic calendar range (day/week/month) |

These will power the future weekly and monthly calendar views in the mobile app (e.g. “show me this week”, “show me my holiday week”, etc.).

---

#### Conflict Detection Engine (v1)

To prepare for more intelligent planning, I built a **light conflict detection engine**.

**New module:** `app/logic/conflict_engine.py`

What it does:

- Builds **time blocks** for each scheduled task using:
  - `datetime`
  - `duration_minutes`
  - `end_datetime`
- If duration isn’t set, it uses default assumptions:
  - events → **60 minutes**
  - reminders → **15 minutes**
- Detects overlapping blocks and returns conflict pairs.

**New endpoint:**

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /tasks/conflicts` | All overlaps across scheduled tasks |
| `GET /tasks/conflicts?start=...&end=...` | Conflicts only within a specific date range |

Example shape of a conflict:

```json
{
  "task_a": { "...": "..." },
  "task_b": { "...": "..." },
  "overlap_start": "2025-12-05 18:00",
  "overlap_end": "2025-12-05 18:30"
}
```

Later this will allow LifeOS to say things like:

> “Your 6pm gym overlaps with dinner at 6:30pm on Friday.”

…without me having to manually spot it.

---

### **3️⃣ Week Statistics & Human Overview**

I also added a **week summary engine** so LifeOS can see the *shape of my week*, not just individual tasks.

#### **New helpers (`week_engine.py`):**

- `get_week_stats()` → JSON stats for the current week:
  - total tasks  
  - total events / reminders  
  - tasks per day  
  - evening tasks (after 18:00)  
  - busiest day  
  - fully free days  
- `get_week_summary_text()` → short, natural-language overview

---

#### **New endpoints:**

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **GET /tasks/week-summary** | JSON statistics for the current week (Mon–Sun) |
| **GET /assistant/week-overview** | Week stats + human-readable summary |

---

#### **Example summary**

> “This week (2025-12-01 → 2025-12-07) you have 7 tasks in total (4 events and 3 reminders).  
> Your busiest day is Sunday with 3 task(s).  
> There are 3 task(s) scheduled for the evening (after 18:00).  
> You still have fully free days on: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday.”

This is exactly the kind of thing a future **LifeOS avatar** could show during a weekly check-in.

---

### **4️⃣ Assistant Insights (v0 — First Real Logic)**

Today I created the first version of the **Insight Engine** — a lightweight but meaningful intelligence layer.

This is the earliest form of “assistant-like” behaviour:  
LifeOS looks at the week and gives small, helpful observations.

#### **New module:**  
`app/logic/insight_engine.py`

#### **For now, it generates insights such as:**  
- “You have no tasks scheduled for today.”  
- “Your next upcoming task is ‘gym’ at 2025-12-05 18:00.”  
- “This week you have 7 tasks (4 events and 3 reminders).”  
- “You have 3 evening task(s). Evenings might get busy.”  
- “Your busiest day is Sunday with 3 task(s).”  
- “You still have fully free days on: Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday.”  
- “You have 1 scheduling conflict(s) that may need attention.”

These are pulled from **real data** — not templates.

---

#### Reflection (Day 4)

Day 3 was about understanding **time**.
Day 4 was about understanding **weeks** and **patterns**.

Today made me realise how much clarity comes from stepping back and looking at patterns, not individual tasks. Implementing the weekly logic and insights taught me how assistants evaluate load, detect conflicts and form summaries. It still isn’t “planning” yet, but the groundwork for actual decision support is now there.

---

### **Day 5:** Today View, Suggestions Engine & Smart Rescheduling (Dec 5, 2025)

Today’s focus was on moving beyond static insights and giving LifeOS the ability to interpret the day, surface actionable suggestions, and offer rescheduling options. These are the first features that start to feel genuinely “assistant-like” — the system now reacts to what it sees instead of simply reporting facts.

---

#### **Today Engine - Structured View of the Day**

I added a dedicated module for understanding *today* with more nuance.  
This includes:

- grouping tasks into **morning / afternoon / evening**
- detecting **free time blocks** between tasks
- estimating **load** (`empty`, `light`, `medium`, `heavy`)
- preparing data for the future Today screen in the UI

**New module:** `app/logic/today_engine.py`

**New endpoint:**

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /assistant/today` | Returns today’s tasks, free blocks, and load level |

Example output:

```json
{
  "date": "2025-12-04",
  "tasks": [],
  "free_blocks": [{"start": "06:00", "end": "22:00"}],
  "load": "empty"
}
```

Even this simple structure is extremely useful for building intelligent behaviour later.

---

### **2️⃣ Assistant Suggestions (v1)**

The assistant can now scan the schedule and offer **light, non-intrusive suggestions**, nothing pushy, just helpful observations when they make sense.

Suggestions are based on:

- conflicts  
- heavy days  
- completely free days  
- large free blocks  

**New endpoint:**

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /assistant/suggestions` | Returns conflict, overload, and free-time suggestions |

**Example suggestion:**

```json
{
  "reason": "conflict",
  "message": "'meeting with flatmates' overlaps with 'video call with relatives'."
}
```

This sets the foundation for future:  
**“Would you like me to move it?”** flows.

---

### **3️⃣ Rescheduling Engine (v1)**

I added the first version of a **rescheduling helper**.  
Given a specific task, the assistant now looks for:

- free time blocks  
- lighter days in the week  
- reasonable alternative times  

**New endpoint:**

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /assistant/reschedule-options?task_id=...` | Suggests new times or days for the selected task |

Even at this early stage, it shows that LifeOS can reason about **where a task belongs**, not just that it exists.

---

### **4️⃣ Category → Colour Map for the UI**

To prepare for the UI layer, LifeOS now exposes a simple category → colour map for consistent visual styling.

**New endpoint:**

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /meta/categories` | Returns colour codes for each category |

---

### **Reflection (Day 5)**

Day 5 shifted LifeOS from *storing* schedules to *interpreting* them.  
Building the Today view, suggestions, and early rescheduling logic made me think more about how assistants spot friction and surface small, meaningful insights.  
It’s still simple, but the system is now reacting to the shape of my day rather than just listing tasks — much closer to the behaviour I originally envisioned.

---

### **Day 6:** Assistant Chat v1, Task Matching & Conflict-Aware Responses (Dec 6, 2025)

Today I focused on making the assistant reliably understand task references, detect conflicts, and return clean, structured responses that the UI can act on. Instead of adding new features, this day was about tightening behaviour and making the AI predictable and safe to integrate later.

---

#### **1️⃣ `/assistant/chat` — Stable JSON-Only Assistant Endpoint**

The chat endpoint now returns **strict, single JSON objects** — no markdown, no extra text.  
This makes the assistant’s output consistent and UI-friendly.

#### **2️⃣ Task Reference Detection (v1)**

I added a safer task-matching utility (ai/utils.py) that prevents false matches (e.g., "run" matching "brunch") using:

- exact match

- whole-word match

- fallback contains match

This lets the assistant correctly identify when the user refers to an existing task.


#### **3️⃣ Conflict-Aware Behaviour**

When the user mentions a task and it has a scheduling conflict, the system bypasses the LLM and returns a structured reschedule flow.

Example: 

```json
{
  "assistant_response": "Your run is scheduled at 10:00 AM tomorrow. Confirm reschedule to 6:00 PM?",
  "ui": {
    "action": "confirm_reschedule",
    "task_id": "...",
    "options": ["18:00"]
  }
}
```

This is powered by:

- updated conflict_engine

- improved rescheduling helper

- stricter system prompt rules

#### **4️⃣ Rescheduling Engine Integration**

I added a wrapper (`generate_reschedule_suggestions_for_task`) so both:

- `/assistant/chat`

- `/assistant/reschedule-options`

use the same suggestion logic.
This ensures consistent options across the whole system.

#### **5️⃣ Cleanup and Alignment Across the API**

- fixed imports (`get_all_tasks`, `load_data`)

- updated main routes to match the new assistant logic

- removed outdated code

- stabilised JSON parsing

The backend is now consistent and ready for UI integration.

#### **Reflection (Day 6)**

Today’s work wasn’t about big new features, it was about making the assistant reliable.

It can now:

- recognise tasks in natural language

- detect when a change affects a scheduled item

- surface rescheduling options cleanly

- speak in predictable JSON the UI can read

This is the first step toward a usable conversational layer.


---


### **Day 7: Confirmation Flow, Executable Actions & Full Assistant Stabilisation (Dec 7, 2025)**

Today was a turning point.  
Instead of adding new endpoints, I focused on making the assistant *actually able to act* — reliably, deterministically, and without confusion.

This was the foundation needed before building the UI.

---

#### **1️⃣ Implemented Confirmation Workflow**

I created a full pending action system so LifeOS can now:

- ask for confirmation (“Should I move ‘run’ to 19:00?”)
- wait for the user’s answer
- execute the action only when the user says “yes”
- cancel cleanly on “no”

This added a real assistant behaviour loop for the first time:

NLP → intent → ask → confirm → execute → update UI

**
**New features added:**

- `create_pending_action`
- `get_current_pending`
- `clear_current_pending`
- persistent storage inside `data.json`

---

#### **2️⃣ Full Yes/No Understanding Inside the Chat Endpoint**

Inside `/assistant/chat`, I implemented deterministic routing:

- **“yes”, “ok”, “sure”, “confirm”** → apply pending action  
- **“no”, “cancel”, “ignore”** → cancel pending action  
- otherwise → normal NLP flow

This made the assistant’s behaviour stable and predictable for the UI.

---

#### **3️⃣ Added Executable Task Actions**

I added backend functions that actually *change* the schedule:

- **apply_reschedule(task_id, new_datetime)**
- **edit_task(task_id, fields)**
- **delete_task(task_id)**

These directly mutate the JSON store so the UI updates instantly after confirmation.

They are used by both:

- `/assistant/chat`
- `/assistant/confirm`

---

#### **4️⃣ Built `/assistant/confirm` Endpoint**

This endpoint executes whichever pending action exists.  
The UI later will call this when a “Yes” button is pressed.

**Example response:**

```json
{
  "assistant_response": "Okay, I moved 'run'.",
  "ui": { "action": "update_task", "task_id": "…" }
}
```

#### **5️⃣ Repaired Task Extraction, Date Matching & Time Understanding**

Throughout the day we resolved several deep issues:

- the assistant confusing **“run”** with **“gym”**
- wrong task selected when multiple tasks shared the same title
- pending actions referencing the wrong task ID
- date parser overriding explicit dates incorrectly
- time parser failing on inputs like “8 am”, “6pm”, etc.

**Fixes included:**

##### ✔ Rewriting the Task Extractor (`try_extract_task_from_message`)  
Now it is:

- **time-aware**
- **date-aware**
- strict in **title-matching**
- safe against fuzzy or misleading matches  
  (e.g., “run” no longer matches “brunch”)

##### ✔ Upgrading the Date Engine (`interpret_datetime`)  
It now correctly interprets:

- **tomorrow / today**
- **weekdays** (Monday–Sunday)
- **explicit numeric times** (“5pm”, “08:30”)
- **semantic times** (morning, afternoon, evening)

These improvements were essential for correct, predictable, conflict-free rescheduling.

---

#### **6️⃣ Added UI Action Schema + Minimal Web Client Connected**

To prepare for the frontend, I finalised stable UI instruction formats such as:

```json
{
  "action": "apply_reschedule",
  "task_id": "...",
  "new_time": "17:00"
}
```


I also built a minimal web client that:

- sends chat messages to **`/assistant/chat`**
- displays backend responses
- shows **pending actions**
- supports **Yes/No confirmation** flows

This created the first fully working **end-to-end conversational assistant loop**.

---

#### **Reflection**

Today’s work transformed LifeOS from a **smart parser** into a **real assistant**.

It can now:

- identify tasks accurately  
- propose schedule changes  
- ask for confirmation  
- execute real mutations  
- update the UI  
- behave consistently across conversations  

This stability was essential before continuing into the React Native UI phase.



---


### **Day 8: Backend → Mobile Connection & Smarter Task Creation (Dec 8, 2025)**

Today wasn’t about visuals — it was about **making LifeOS actually run on a real device** and stabilising the conversational engine.  
Most of the work focused on *connecting*, *fixing*, and *making the assistant behave reliably*, not designing final UI elements.



#### **1️⃣ Smarter Task Creation (Time Ranges, Weekdays, Better Parsing)**

Improved natural-language understanding for:

- “add gym at 6pm”
- “work from 9 to 5”
- “add study session tomorrow at 8am”
- “meeting Friday afternoon”

Fixes included:

- detecting natural time ranges (`from X to Y`)
- auto-calculating duration + end time
- improved weekday mapping
- more accurate date/time interpretation

This made task creation consistent and predictable.


#### **2️⃣ Early Conflict Detection + Simple Slot Suggestion**

Before creating or rescheduling a task, the assistant now:

- checks for overlaps  
- warns the user  
- suggests the nearest free slot  

This is the first step toward full conflict-awareness in the UI.


#### **3️⃣ Added `/assistant/bootstrap` Endpoint**

Created a new unified bootstrap endpoint returning:

- Today view  
- Week stats  
- Suggestions  
- Conflict info  
- Category colors  
- Pending actions  

This prepares the backend for proper app screens (Today, Week, Calendar).



#### **4️⃣ React Native App Setup (Expo) + Real Device Backend Connection**

Main achievement of the day.

Completed:

- Created the React Native + Expo project
- Added tab navigation (Today, Assistant, Explore)
- Built a functional chat screen
- Connected the iPhone Expo Go app to FastAPI backend
- Fixed network/localhost issues (using device IP instead of 127.0.0.1)
- Verified real device → backend communication

The UI is still minimal — the focus was functionality.



#### **5️⃣ First True End-to-End Loop on Mobile**

From the phone, I successfully:

- checked today/tomorrow schedules  
- created events  
- rescheduled tasks  
- confirmed actions  
- watched the JSON data update live  

LifeOS officially became a **mobile assistant**, not just a backend.

---

#### **Reflection**

Day 8 wasn’t a “design” day — it was a **plumbing, fixing, and connecting day**.

But it achieved something huge:

### **Day 9:** Today View Refinement & UI Foundation (Dec 9, 2025)

Today was a lighter day, but an important one for aligning the direction of the mobile UI.

Building on yesterday’s backend → mobile integration, I focused on improving the structure and clarity of the **Today View**. This included:

- adding the first version of the **time-aware greeting**  
- connecting the **load meter** from the backend to the UI  
- cleaning the layout of the **morning / afternoon / evening** sections  
- rendering **free time blocks** and early **insights**  
- fixing several UI bugs (component imports, routing, and null mappings)

These are small but necessary steps toward a clean, minimal iOS-style interface.

I also finalised the **visual direction** for LifeOS:  
a calm, neutral, minimal iOS aesthetic with moderately rounded components. This foundation will guide all UI improvements going forward.

Not a big feature day — but still consistent progress, keeping the momentum of the challenge.

#### **Reflection (Day 9)**

Even though today’s progress was small, it felt meaningful. After several days of backend-heavy work, shifting attention toward the mobile UI made the project feel more “real” and closer to what I ultimately want LifeOS to become. 

Defining the visual direction, calm, minimal, and iOS-native, created a sense of clarity for the rest of the challenge. The Today View is still early, but the structure is forming, and every small improvement makes the app feel more coherent.

### **Day 10:** UI Stability, Bug Fixes & Early Design Planning (Dec 10, 2025)

Today was a quiet but important day focused on stabilising the mobile UI and preparing for the next stage of design work.

I spent most of the time:

- fixing UI bugs (imports, routing, undefined elements)  
- resolving backend ↔ frontend naming mismatches  
- cleaning the Today View layout for consistency  
- improving task grouping and free-block rendering  
- thinking through the broader app structure (Today → Week → Month)

Not a big visual day, but a strong foundational one — the app feels more stable and ready for the deeper design work ahead.

#### **Reflection**

Even without major new features, today’s progress mattered.  
Fixing small issues, improving consistency, and clarifying how the UI should flow helps prevent rework later and keeps the project aligned with the long-term vision.

### **Day 11:** Today View UI Alignment & Backend Sync (Dec 11, 2025)

Today was focused on getting the redesigned LifeOS Today View fully aligned with the backend. After making the strategic choice to use React Web for speed and design consistency (instead of the more complex React Native), I finalized the app’s core layout in Lovable. I then shifted my attention to rebuilding the logic and data flow needed to support this cleaner UI structure.

#### **What I Worked On**

- **Horizontal Day Scroller (WIP):** Implemented the UI and began wiring logic to load tasks for specific dates.
- **Energy Status Card:** Connected the BalanceScoreCard to backend load calculations so the app now reflects daily workload and completion progress in real time.
- **Task Structure Update:** Replaced the old morning/afternoon/evening buckets with a simpler format:
  - **Scheduled tasks** → tasks with time;
  - **Anytime tasks** → flexible tasks without a time;
- **Manual Task Creation:** Implemented the AddTask modal; new tasks now appear instantly in the Today View and update the energy/load indicator.

#### **Backend Updates**

To support the new frontend architecture, several backend components were rebuilt:

- **Frontend Adapter Layer:** Converts backend task objects into the format expected by the UI.
- **Extended Task Model:** Added duration, endTime calculation, and value/category mapping.
- **Updated Today View Engine:** Now returns structured data with grouped tasks, load level, and free blocks.
- **New & Updated Endpoints:** Added create/update/delete/move task endpoints in frontend-compatible format, and extended `/assistant/today` with optional date support.

#### **Reflection (Day 11)**

This was a structural day, but an important one. The frontend and backend finally speak the same language thanks to the new adapter layer, and the Today View now feels coherent and responsive. There’s still design polishing ahead, but the foundation built on the React Web standard is now strong enough to confidently build the more complex calendar views.

### **Day 12:** Check-In System & Energy Status (Dec 12, 2025)

Today focused on completing two closely related foundations of LifeOS:  
the **Daily Check-In flow** and the **Energy Status logic** that reflects daily workload honestly and consistently.

Together, these changes moved LifeOS closer to behaving like a real operating system — one that clearly separates **execution**, **load**, and **reflection**.

#### **What I Worked On**

- **Daily Check-In Flow:** Completed the multi-step check-in modal allowing users to:
  - Review and toggle completed tasks
  - Handle incomplete tasks by moving them to future dates
  - Write a daily reflection note
- **Real-Time Task Updates:** Ensured task completion and rescheduling happen immediately when the user interacts, not at the end of the check-in.
- **Reflection as Snapshot:** Designed the check-in to act as a historical record of the day, capturing what happened without mutating task state retroactively.
- **Energy Status Behaviour:** Finalised how the Today View energy indicator works so it reflects **planned workload**, not momentary progress.
- **Frontend–Backend Sync:** Fully wired the Lovable UI to backend endpoints so state stays consistent across Today, Calendar, Energy Status, and Check-In flows.

#### **Backend Updates**

Several backend additions and refinements were made to support both check-ins and energy tracking:

- **New Check-In Endpoints:**
  - `POST /checkins` — create or update a daily check-in
  - `GET /checkins?date=YYYY-MM-DD` — retrieve a check-in for a specific day
- **Check-In Persistence:** Check-ins are stored in `data.json` as dated records containing:
  - completed task IDs
  - incomplete task IDs
  - moved tasks (with new dates)
  - reflection note
  - timestamp
- **Energy Status Calculation:**
  - Calculated fully on the backend
  - Step 1: Sum **total scheduled minutes** for the day (anytime tasks excluded)
  - Step 2: Compare against a **daily capacity of 480 minutes (8 hours)**
  - Step 3: If total scheduled minutes ≥ **624 minutes (130% of capacity)** → `Prioritize Rest`
  - Step 4: Otherwise, compute a **weighted task load**:
    - Anytime tasks → weight 0.5  
    - Scheduled ≤ 30 min → weight 1.0  
    - Scheduled 30–90 min → weight 1.5  
    - Scheduled > 90 min → weight 2.0  
  - Step 5: Map total weight to:
    - `Space Available`
    - `Balanced Pacing`
    - `Prioritize Rest`
  - Energy labels are **fixed for the day** and do not change as tasks are completed
- **Task Operations During Check-In:**
  - Task completion toggles update task state immediately
  - Task moves update task dates immediately and track original dates
- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Task logic is deterministic and immediate; energy reflects planned demand; check-ins are purely reflective and historical.

#### **Reflection (Day 12)**

This was a key architectural day. Energy status, task execution, and daily reflection are now clearly separated, making the system more honest and predictable. Heavy days remain heavy even when handled well, progress is visible without rewriting reality, and check-ins act as trustworthy daily logs rather than hidden control mechanisms.

LifeOS now feels less like a task app and more like an operating system that understands **load, action, and reflection as distinct layers**.

### **Day 13:** Reminders & Settings (Dec 13, 2025)

Today focused on completing two core system layers in LifeOS: **Reminders** and **Settings**, with a strong emphasis on simplicity, consistency, and calm UX.


#### **What Was Built**

##### **Reminders**
- Full CRUD reminders flow with backend sync
- Grouped views: **Today**, **Upcoming**, **Past**
- Two reminder types:
  - **Notify** → sends a notification at a set time
  - **Show** → appears on Today View only (no time required)
- Reminders surface directly on the **Today screen**
- Removed urgency levels and multiple notification counts to reduce complexity


##### **Settings**
- Clean, minimal structure with only essential options:
  - Profile (user, timezone, language)
  - Task categories & week start
  - Reminder defaults
  - Data & privacy actions
- Navigation and spacing aligned with Reminders page


##### **Category Colors**
- Centralized category color system
- Dynamic color usage across:
  - Month Calendar
  - Week Timetable
  - Today View
- Removed hardcoded colors; added consistent fallback


##### **Backend**
- Added reminder update endpoint
- Ensured reminders without time are supported
- Backend remains source of truth with frontend sync

---

#### **Reflection (Day 13)**

LifeOS now handles **remembering**, **showing**, and **configuring** in a calm, intentional way. The system feels more complete, less noisy, and closer to a real personal operating system.

---


### **Day 14**: Calendar View Month & Week (Dec 14, 2025)

Day 14 focused on implementing LifeOS’s **Calendar system**, introducing fully functional **Month** and **Week** views backed by efficient date-range loading. This completes the core planning layer and moves LifeOS closer to a true personal operating system.

---

#### What Was Built

##### Calendar Views
- **Month View** — high-level overview and pattern recognition
- **Week View** — time-based execution and scheduling (scheduled tasks only)


#### Backend

##### New Endpoint
**GET `/tasks/calendar?start={start}&end={end}`**
- Returns all tasks within a date range
- Optimised for month/week calendar loading
- Reduces per-day API calls

Existing endpoints reused for categories, notes, and check-ins.


#### Frontend

##### Core Page
**`Calendar.tsx`**
- Month / Week toggle
- Date navigation (buttons + swipe)
- Date-range task loading
- Category filtering

##### Month View
**`MonthCalendar.tsx`**
- Grid-based monthly layout
- Colored task blocks with truncation (`+N more`)
- Today highlighted with subtle border
- Category filtering
- Swipe to change month

##### Week View
**`WeekScheduleView.tsx`**
- Time grid (6:00–21:00)
- **Scheduled tasks only**
- Tasks positioned and sized by duration
- Today column emphasis
- Swipe to change week

##### Category Filters
**`CalendarFilters.tsx`**
- Collapsible filter UI (default collapsed)
- Multi-select category pills
- Filter state persisted in localStorage


#### State & Data Flow

- Added `loadTasksForDateRange()` to Zustand store
- Cached task merging to avoid duplicates
- Single API call per month/week for performance


---

#### Reflection

LifeOS now has a **scalable, performant calendar** that supports both long-term planning and daily execution, built on deterministic logic and ready for future intelligence layers.

---

## Next Steps

- Enable **task interactions** directly from the calendar:
  - View task details
  - Edit tasks
  - Delete tasks
  - Add new tasks from both Month and Week views
- Prepare calendar UI for Assistant integration
